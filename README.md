This may be my tenth attempt at doing this, and it was FINALLY successful. 

I spent a day or so before doing this slowly writing the linked repository out to video explanations. I programmed it myself, so it was original, but I wanted to test myself by doing it again with no reference (apart from the backpropogation). This is the repository in which I do that, and it took me about 30-40 minutes, as I copied and pasted the test function, and some of the tests down at the bottom.
