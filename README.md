This may be my tenth attempt at doing this, and it was FINALLY successful. 

I spent a day or so before doing this slowly writing the linked repository out to video explanations. I programmed it myself, so it was original, but I wanted to test myself by doing it again with no reference (apart from the backpropogation). This is the repository in which I do that, and it took me about 30-40 minutes, as I copied and pasted the test function, and some of the tests down at the bottom.

Useful links:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIeHLnjs5U8 - amazing backpropogation explanation if you do it yourself.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hfMk-kjRv4c&t=1207s - initial project idea and inspired the structure and gave some of the know-how.
Not everything was taken from those videos, but you could definitely make one using only those two.
